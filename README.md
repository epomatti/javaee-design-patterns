# Java EE Design Patterns

Java EE design patterns implemented to prepare for my OCMJEA6 certification.

To run this code simply:

- Clone the repo
- Import as composed Maven project into your favorite IDE
- Run Main classes for each pattern you want to

Each design pattern code is stored within it's own Maven module.
